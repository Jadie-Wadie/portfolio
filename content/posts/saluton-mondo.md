Hello! I'm [Jaiden Douglas](https://github.com/ja1den).

I plan to write a post on here at least once a month, covering interesting things I've found, or discussing my active projects. I haven't written any blog posts before, so hopefully they'll improve over time.

There isn't much else to say, so let's get started.

# Paintball

I recently discovered [MLAPI](https://mlapi.network/), an SDK for creating multiplayer games in [Unity](https://unity.com/). Looking at the documentation, I'm excited, because it doesn't seem to have some of the limitations [PUN](https://www.photonengine.com/pun) has.

MLAPI can run in three different modes: as a client, as a server, and as a host. The server mode is the thing that gets me excited, as it means I can run a dedicated server on my own hardware, something PUN doesn't let you do.

I'm planning to build a multiplayer paintball game, similar to [diep.io](https://diep.io/), and host it on my production machine. I'll probably write about my progress in the next several posts, so stay tuned for that.
